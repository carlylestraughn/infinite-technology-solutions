        <p>At Gilead, I had the privilege of working with Gordon Straughn for more than a decade while he served as our R&amp;D recruiting partner. During my 23+ years supporting the CSO and working closely with the R&amp;D leadership team, the company experienced an extraordinary period of growth and expansion into new therapeutic areas. Gordon was instrumental in building and strengthening our R&amp;D organization throughout this time.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">What truly set Gordon apart was his ability to understand the nuances of each role – across research, clinical, regulatory and CMC – and to consistently match the right candidate to the right position. He has a remarkable ability for reading people and assessing their capabilities, combined with a deep understanding of the scientific and operational needs across R&amp;D.</p>

        <p>It is my pleasure to endorse Gordon Straughn as an outstanding recruiter in the biopharma industry. As an MD/PhD candidate pursuing my next role, I had the privilege of meeting Gordon and working with him to understand the fit of various opportunities in the field with what I was looking for. Gordon's guidance was instrumental in helping me secure a role that was aligned with my long-term goals and professional values and where it was clear what value I would bring to the new organization I joined.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">What set Gordon apart was not only his deep knowledge of the biopharma landscape, but also his personalized approach and commitment to understanding what was going to make a sustainable match between my future employer and me. Gordon took the time to understand my unique background, aspirations, and strengths, and then, as he matched me with opportunities that looked like the right fit, helped me to test that fit through the process. He was communicative, transparent, and supportive at every step — while preparing me for interviews, providing insight into company culture, or advocating on my behalf with hiring teams — and he made himself available not only during the hiring process, but afterward. I have stayed in touch with Gordon many years and several jobs after we first met, because he makes that kind of relationship-building commitment to the clients and candidates he represents.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Thanks to Gordon’s professionalism, diligence, and genuine long-term commitment to my success, I was able to secure a position that has advanced both my career and personal growth — a job that I truly loved at an organization where I was able to have huge positive impact! I would wholeheartedly recommend Gordon Straughn to any professional seeking to navigate the competitive biopharma job market. He inspires total confidence, because he's a true expert at bringing the right people into the right roles.</p>

Their professionalism, strategic approach, and dedication to a personalized search process truly set them apart.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Over the course of our partnership, Gordon from Biocruit Solutions has been instrumental in identifying and securing top-tier talent for critical leadership positions. Gordon possesses a keen eye for candidates who not only have the right skills and experience, but also a cultural alignment that ensures long-term success. Their meticulous vetting process and insightful candidate summaries have saved us valuable time and resources, allowing us to focus on our core business.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">I have had the unique pleasure of working with Gordon both when he was in-house at Gilead and as an external search partner. In both capacities, he excelled due to his ability to read people, offer measured, calm guidance and advice even during difficult business circumstances, and provide deep strategic thinking when others struggled to find solutions. Gordon's ability to specifically uncover hard-to-find MD talent is truly second to none. He also dedicates significant time to educating candidates from academia about the industry, and guiding candidates and their families through challenging job change circumstances such as relocation, school changes for children, and trailing partners.</p>

His firm took the time to deeply understand our company's mission and values, acting as true ambassadors throughout the search process. I have been consistently impressed by their responsiveness and the strategic guidance they provided at every stage, even if it means they don't ultimately get the placement.</p>

        <p>Gordon was a trusted Talent Acquisition Advisor and thought partner to many leaders during my almost 12 years at Gilead. He filled a number of Director and above roles as well as hard to fill roles across multiple teams in the R&amp;D organization. His ability to quickly understand our business needs and educate us of the complex, ever changing pharmaceutical recruiting landscape was invaluable during a high period of growth for the company.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">As a TA leader, having Gordon work on unique and hard to fill roles allowed me to load balance my overall recruiting team's requisitions more efficiently. His recruiting process aligned well with our recruiting process so hiring managers had a seamless hiring experience.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">What sets Gordon apart from other TA partners is his consistent communication, ability to find not only strong candidates from a technical standpoint but also from a cultural match. He is able to truly find what a candidate is passionate about with their next step of their career and align it well with where the business and company is headed. He guides hiring managers and candidates through the whole recruiting process ensuring every base is covered along the way. I highly recommend Gordon for all your team's Talent Acquisition needs!</p>
